# Module 8: Azure AI Search Reference Architecture

## Introduction

This module provides guidance on implementing a secure, production-ready Azure AI Search solution by leveraging Microsoft's recommended reference architecture. Instead of building a landing zone from scratch, we'll refer you to the existing Microsoft-maintained solution.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the key components of a production-ready Azure AI Search architecture
- Access Microsoft's reference architecture resources for Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search
- Implement recommended security and networking practices

## Azure OpenAI Landing Zone Reference Architecture

Microsoft maintains a comprehensive reference architecture for securely deploying Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search solutions:

### [Azure OpenAI Landing Zone Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openai-landing-zone/tree/main/foundation)

This official GitHub repository provides:

- Ready-to-deploy IaC templates for Azure OpenAI and related services
- Security and networking best practices 
- Identity management recommendations
- Monitoring and observability patterns
- CI/CD pipeline examples

## Key Security Considerations

When implementing Azure AI Search in production, focus on these key areas:

### Network Isolation

- Use private endpoints to eliminate public internet access
- Implement network security groups with appropriate rules
- Restrict access to specific VNets and subnets

### Identity Management

- Use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication
- Implement the principle of least privilege
- Assign appropriate built-in roles or create custom RBAC roles
- Use managed identities for service-to-service communication

### Data Protection

- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Use customer-managed keys for sensitive workloads
- Apply data exfiltration controls

### Monitoring and Observability

- Configure comprehensive diagnostic logging
- Set up monitoring and alerts for key metrics
- Implement proper audit trails

## Next Steps

1. Visit the [Azure OpenAI Landing Zone Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openai-landing-zone/tree/main/foundation) repository
2. Review the provided architecture and IaC templates
3. Adapt the templates to your specific requirements
4. Deploy using the provided automation scripts
